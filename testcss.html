				<p>My name is Chris Allen, I was born in Fort Worth and have lived in the area pretty much all my life until recently. I went to Aledo High School, infamous for defeating Western Hills of FWISD 91 to 0 one year in football getting a bullying complaint from a parent from the other school which went on to be national news. I also went to Texas Christian University in Fort Worth notorious for buying a $50,000 Ronald McDonald esque statue bench of our mascot, Super Frog, as well as the student council voting for 2 ply toilet paper. What do you think I am? A plebian?. </p>
				
				<p>I am currently trying to learn the banjo as well as code and have taken 5 combined years of Spanish making me fluent enough to ask where el ba√±o is when the flow gets going. I lived in Costa Rica for 2 and a half months interning with a company my dad was associated with but didn't capitalize on it because I'm a huge square and other shapes do better letting loose. Finally I have 3 years of experience working as a supervisor with JCPenney at a warehouse where I learned work flow as well as basic jewelry repair knowledge. I got a little worn down by the 5 a.m. start time and the 40 minute commute so I am now trying to learn coding to expand my career. You may wonder why my user name is Captain Newport but that's for you to figure out. Or when I can show you I will also do that. But for now- it's for you to figure out.</p>
